<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

# About The Project

In 2024 I had a trip planned to go to Japan. I am not on most social medias where many of my family members are so I wanted an easy way to share photos with them combined with the gps location of where I was currently at when I took that photo. I thought it could be a cool way for them to follow me along on my trip. So I spent 3 months building Snapsmaps. I then went on my trip in August for a grand total of 22 days. I always planned to make it self-hostable and open source for everyone and I finally got around to doing that.
